# AI-Holiday-Rental-Guide
A demo for an AI chatbot which helps you find your perfect holiday rental. By default it will look for places in the fictional country of Colland, but you can add your own properties.txt file (delete the old one) and it will still work.

You will need to provide your own OpenAI API key. 
  1) Create a new file in the same folder where the program will be run
  2) Inside the file, write OPENAI_API_KEY=\<your openai key\>
  3) Save as a .env file (making sure you're saving it in the same folder)

By default, the program uses gpt-4o-mini. Pricing for OpenAI's API can be found at https://openai.com/api/pricing/
